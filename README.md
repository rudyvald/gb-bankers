## Overview ##

GB React Coding challenge was requested, only production version was created in this stage.

## Process

I used native react without babble for now to keep it as basic as possible. If I had more time for this project I would have created a mockup and created a better more dynamic (and good looking) GUI. Other features I would have liked to implement would be masking for phone numbers, a custom service and database to store information, routings including /register and /login and /profile. I had an issue with CSS not loading on an external file, not sure why. Didn't seem to necessary since there isn't much CSS so it is in the index file.
